MESSAGE TO REVIEWER:

Hello,

I've added 6 portfolio layouts, and 7 project layouts. Portfolio now supports various styling with respect to it's caption and image. In addition to that, I've added 2 blog layouts (minimal + magazine). Portfolio and Blog, both supports 3 type of pagination(numbered, button, and infinite scroll).

In addition to that I've added 3 ready-made templates for the contact page and 2 templates for the about us page.

The theme now supports background audio and video, in addition to background image.

Furthermore, the theme now has a built-in header builder as well as 5 pre-made layouts for the header and 2 layouts for the site footer.

The theme now also supports typography control of each theme element from the customizer and I've also improved control of page colors which includes ability of the user to define a custom color pallete for each page.

Regards

----------------------

Thanks for looking into it. I'll address each of your raised issue in the same order:

1: I've improved the contrast ratio. The text is dim because I want to keep the emphasis on the main text (i.e. links).
2: The error, "theme appears to be in wrong directory" is because I've added an underscore to the theme directory. It is needed to avoid wrong theme update notification which updates this theme to a theme with same name in WordPress official repository. So, the directory is named "_nucleus" instead of "nucleus" to avoid this issue. More on this issue: https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14179
3: Fixed. I've improved the contrast.
4: Fixed the padding issues.
5: Fixed. I've run the whole site through this validator and have fixed all the errors and most of the warnings.
6: I've improved the UX issue. Now clicking outside the sidebar also closes it.
7: The underscore is actually required to tell wordpress that it is not the same theme as this one: (https://wordpress.org/themes/nucleus/). More detail can be found in point # 2.
8: Fixed. The search form was going out of screen because tons of categor links. I've now configured it to show only hand-picked categories.
9: I've added option to display date in both formats (i.e. standard and "time ago" format). The default is standard format.
10: I've developed the theme with WP_DEBUG enabled. I cannot reproduce any PHP error or warning on my installation. Is there any specific scenerio or error I should look into?
11: I've removed the unnecessary dropcap styling. I've also fixed the admin bar overlapping issue.
12: Fixed. Now the blog as well as page should display sidebar (on clicking the arrow at right side of the page).

----------------------

Following is the summary of my changes. Please re-read specially point no # 4.

1: Fixed.
2: I've updated all portfolio images to look more sharp for HiDPi screens.
3: Further improved the contrast by dimming down the background. Now (https://ibb.co/HVfGTzc), Before (https://ibb.co/cxLfhdy). Also for the comments, Before (https://ibb.co/Lv2ktrM) and After (https://ibb.co/n3TBWmv).
4: AGAIN: The extra _ in folder name is not a design choice but a compulsion to avoid a bug in WordPress core. If I don't add this _ in theme folder name, the WordPress assumes that it is this theme (https://wordpress.org/themes/nucleus/), which obviously it is not. After assuming so WordPress display a theme update notification, and if a user clicks on it, it will overwrite my theme with the one in official theme repository. You can see more info on this bug here: (https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14179)
5: I've added another section to this page and have updated the text to be more relevant. I want to keep this page elements to minimal since it's for freelancers.
6: Fixed.
7: Fixed. Some menu locations were redundantly registered. I've removed them. All menu locations works now. Please note that "Secondary" and "Top Bar" menu location will only work if relevent menu item is enabled via theme customizer.
8: Fixed.
9: Fixed. The CSS is auto-generated from SCSS files. I've configured it to format it in more readable style.
10: Fixed.
11: Fixed.
12: Fixed.
13: AGAIN: I'm unable to reproduce the issue on my installation. Since, the sidebar and widgets are displaying. Watch this loom video: https://www.loom.com/share/f6953e699e53456f8c41377fdada8a12

----------------------

Please note that I'm addressing each of the raised issue with my explanation. If you think my explanations or solution is flawed please elaborate it. I'm NOT ignoring any issue.

Following is the summary of my changes. 

1: Fixed. I've further improved sharpness of portfolio and about page images. For example, Before (https://ibb.co/y41dtTk) - After (https://ibb.co/n1G0Bty). Also, Before (https://ibb.co/XbfmwPW) - After (https://ibb.co/tPhDsRm). There are also other examples.
2: Fixed. Now all menu locations are visible by DEFAULT.
3: Fixed. Now non-modified version of JS and CSS file is also included.
4: Fixed. I've further improved the color contrast. Before (https://ibb.co/jkqKdmV), After (https://ibb.co/KmSt4Zc).
5: Fixed. I've made sure that all widgets with nested links are displaying correctly. Before (https://envato.d.pr/ZRaTIY), After (https://ibb.co/2YPFrrp)

----------------------

I've now used a different approach to enhance the images. It is much better now. Before (https://portfolio.blacksailor.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/portfolio-slide-01.webp) - After (https://portfolio.blacksailor.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/portfolio-slide-01-1.webp)

----------------------

1: Fixed. The menu should not wrap now.
2: Fixed. Changed the Date Format.
3: Fixed. Improved contrast issue in certain areas.
4: Fixed. Improved mobile styling in certain areas.

----------------------

1: I've added multiple details to this menu. a) animations on menu item when the menu is opened. b) hover arrow animation on menu items.
2: I've added background color and button to the search field. Before (https://envato.d.pr/gth1o1), After (https://ibb.co/h72RYjk).
3: The reason why some pages are dark and some have light skin is to show customizability of the theme. Each page in the theme can have a unique color scheme which can be set via a meta panel (see here: https://ibb.co/RyhLGn2). It means the customer has the option to have all site pages in dark skin or light skin or a mix of both.
4: I've made some supplementary adjustements.

----------------------

1: Lightbox is now enabled on all applicable links. User has the option to disable it however. Also all portfolio links have been fixed.
2: I've adjusted the contrast ratio for the "Load More" button. As for the portfolio example, the other items are out of focus (thus the opacity effect). In this style of portfolio, we can only have one focused portfolio item.
3: I've made some improvements. If you still see an issue a screenshot would be helpful.
4: I've made some improvements. If you still see an issue a screenshot would be helpful.
5: Fixed.
6: All widgets are styled correctly in the sidebar, including the screenshot mentioned. It is supposed to appear like this.
7: I've made some improvements. If you still see an issue a screenshot would be helpful.
8: Fixed.
9: Fixed. All translated strings are escaped now.
10: POT file is updated.
11: Fixed. Attribures are now using esc_attr__() instead of esc_html__().
