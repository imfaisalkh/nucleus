MESSAGE TO REVIEWER:

Hello,

I've added 6 portfolio layouts, and 7 project layouts. Portfolio now supports various styling with respect to it's caption and image. In addition to that, I've added 2 blog layouts (minimal + magazine). Portfolio and Blog, both supports 3 type of pagination(numbered, button, and infinite scroll).

In addition to that I've added 3 ready-made templates for the contact page and 2 templates for the about us page.

The theme now supports background audio and video, in addition to background image.

Furthermore, the theme now has a built-in header builder as well as 5 pre-made layouts for the header and 2 layouts for the site footer.

The theme now also supports typography control of each theme element from the customizer and I've also improved control of page colors which includes ability of the user to define a custom color pallete for each page.

Regards

----------------------

Thanks for looking into it. I'll address each of your raised issue in the same order:

1: I've improved the contrast ratio. The text is dim because I want to keep the emphasis on the main text (i.e. links).
2: The error, "theme appears to be in wrong directory" is because I've added an underscore to the theme directory. It is needed to avoid wrong theme update notification which updates this theme to a theme with same name in WordPress official repository. So, the directory is named "_nucleus" instead of "nucleus" to avoid this issue. More on this issue: https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14179
3: Fixed. I've improved the contrast.
4: Fixed the padding issues.
5: Fixed. I've run the whole site through this validator and have fixed all the errors and most of the warnings.
6: I've improved the UX issue. Now clicking outside the sidebar also closes it.
7: The underscore is actually required to tell wordpress that it is not the same theme as this one: (https://wordpress.org/themes/nucleus/). More detail can be found in point # 2.
8: Fixed. The search form was going out of screen because tons of categor links. I've now configured it to show only hand-picked categories.
9: I've added option to display date in both formats (i.e. standard and "time ago" format). The default is standard format.
10: I've developed the theme with WP_DEBUG enabled. I cannot reproduce any PHP error or warning on my installation. Is there any specific scenerio or error I should look into?
11: I've removed the unnecessary dropcap styling. I've also fixed the admin bar overlapping issue.
12: Fixed. Now the blog as well as page should display sidebar (on clicking the arrow at right side of the page).

----------------------

Following is the summary of my changes. Please re-read specially point no # 4.

1: Fixed.
2: I've updated all portfolio images to look more sharp for HiDPi screens.
3: Further improved the contrast by dimming down the background. Now (https://ibb.co/HVfGTzc), Before (https://ibb.co/cxLfhdy). Also for the comments, Before (https://ibb.co/Lv2ktrM) and After (https://ibb.co/n3TBWmv).
4: AGAIN: The extra _ in folder name is not a design choice but a compulsion to avoid a bug in WordPress core. If I don't add this _ in theme folder name, the WordPress assumes that it is this theme (https://wordpress.org/themes/nucleus/), which obviously it is not. After assuming so WordPress display a theme update notification, and if a user clicks on it, it will overwrite my theme with the one in official theme repository. You can see more info on this bug here: (https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14179)
5: I've added another section to this page and have updated the text to be more relevant. I want to keep this page elements to minimal since it's for freelancers.
6: Fixed.
7: Fixed. Some menu locations were redundantly registered. I've removed them. All menu locations works now. Please note that "Secondary" and "Top Bar" menu location will only work if relevent menu item is enabled via theme customizer.
8: Fixed.
9: Fixed. The CSS is auto-generated from SCSS files. I've configured it to format it in more readable style.
10: Fixed.
11: Fixed.
12: Fixed.
13: AGAIN: I'm unable to reproduce the issue on my installation. Since, the sdiebar and widgets are displaying. Watch this loom video: https://www.loom.com/share/f6953e699e53456f8c41377fdada8a12
